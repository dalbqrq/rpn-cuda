2. Compiling

Before compiling RPn code, you have to set up some environmental variables. There are
two configuration script to help you with that: one for csh shell and another one if
you are using the bash. 

If you use csh, edit 'bin/env-cshrc' file and change the line:

   setenv RPNHOME /example/of/rpnhome/directory

to your RPn home directory. If you are using bash, edit 'bin/env-bash' file and change
the following line:

   export RPNHOME=/example/of/rpnhome/directory

After running one of these scripts, you'll be prepared to compile RPn. Now, you just
have to go to 'src' directory and type:

   make
