RPn User Manual
version : 1.2
Author: Mario de Sa Vera

I- Installation in UNIX systems @1

1- Extract the rpn package from the directory where the
jar file has being saved :

# jar -xf rpn.jar 

2- Configure your environment for rpn

# source .cshrc-rpn

3- Run the rpn Plotter application

# rpn

II- Instalation in Windows @2(Java and DOS prompt available)

1- Unzip the rpn package from the directory where
the Zip file has being saved :

C% unzip rpn.zip

2- Run the BATCH file :

C% rpn.bat


II- Application Functionalities

We will define the major features of the application which are available
via Control Frame interaction :

1- Orbit Calculation

	Select the Orbit Plotting button from the toolbar and
specifiy the location in the Projected Planes to start the calculation

2- Stationary Point Calculation

	Select the Stationary Point Plotting button from the toolbar and
specifiy the location in the Projected Planes to start the calculation. The
program will locate the closest Equilibrium point from the user input
location.

3- Manifold Calculation

	USER

A. After StationaryPoint calculation completed select the Manifold Plotting
button from the toolbar;

B. Specifiy the location in the Projected Planes for the Manifold to include
in it's orbit to start the calculation by mouse click in the phase space;

	SYSTEM

C. The button is toggled and any other calculation is unselected;

D. The start point for the Manifold's orbit is the closest Stationary Point
from the user input.

4- Define Poincare Section

	Select the Poincare Section button from the toolbar and
specify n input coordinates where n = Domain Space dimension. For dimension
higher than 2 the user will have to use the set of projection planes to
specify one single input coordinate and follow the mouse cursor orientation.

5- Saddle to Saddle Profile Calculation

	After plotting time opposite directional Manifolds (forward/backward) the
Find Profile menu item will be enable. @4

7- Change Sigma Value

	Select the Change Sigma Value from Menu and specify a coodinate for the sigma
calculation. This configuration change will trigger a recalculation for the plotted 
calculations. @4
	
8- Change Flux Params

	From the Config menu select the Change Flux Params item and after specifying 
the new values click the Update button.This configuration change will trigger a 
recalculation for the plotted calculations.

9- Change X0

	Select the Change Sigma Value from Menu and specify a coodinate for the sigma
calculation. This configuration change will trigger a recalculation for the plotted
calculations.

10- Fills the Phase Space
	
	The User can run the Fill Phase Space feature to analyze the distribution of 
Orbits (forward/backward) over the Phase Space.
