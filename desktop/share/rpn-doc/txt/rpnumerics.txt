	The RP Numerics library conceptual model defines a set of components
which encapsulates the mathematics model elements following the theories behind
Conservation Laws Dynbamics @1

The most relevant elements in the Problem Domain are :

* Phase Point

	A point in the Phase Space.

* Orbit Point

	A point in the Phase Space with a time associated with an Orbit passing through the point.

* Orbit

	A set of Orbit points calculated through integration methods.

* Manifold

	A Manifold is an Orbit which tends to a stationary point.

* Stationary Point

	A point in the Phase Space where the only orbit is the point itself.

There are 4 main types of Stationary Points :

Attracting - m1 < m2 < 0
Hyperbolic (or Saddle) - m1 < 0 < m2
Repelling - 0 < m1 < m2
Elliptical - m1 and m2 are complex

(where m1 and m2 are the mu coeficients)

* Wave State

	A wave state is defined by an initial and a final Stationary points and an associated speed.

* Wave Curve

	A Wave Curve is a set of Wave states constructed appropriately by construction of Shock , Rarefaction or Composite subcurves.

* Auxiliary Curves

	Auxiliary curves help the evaluation of curves calculation by comparison to well known results. Example : Hugoniot Curve, Integral Curve, AuxComposite Curve etc...

* Profile

	A profile is a Phase Curve that has an initial and a final Stationary point. (review please ... TODO)

* Physics

	Defines the kind of physical problem being solved.

* Flux Function

	A Flux Function defines the interface for the Physics layer with the proper derivatives. Example : Quadratic Flux ,Triphase Flux etc...

* Wave Flow

	Waves are usually constructed by Integrating some kind of Flow. Example : Shock Flow, Rarefaction and Composite Flow.

* Shock Curve


* Rarefaction Curve

* Composite Curve
