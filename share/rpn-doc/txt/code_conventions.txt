Coding Conventions for Sofware Development at Fluid


1- Code Organization

	The code should be divided on blocks 
following the pattern :

//
// Constants
//

//
// Members
//

//
// Constructors/Initializers
//

//
// Accessors/Mutators
//

//
// Methods
//

2- Naming Conventions

	We will be following the recommendations
from Sun for members and methods naming. A complete
definition of Sun conventions can be found at :

http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/

	One extra convention for class members naming
will be used. An underscored should be added to each 
member of a class which should also be declared private
and be accessed by the Accessors/Mutators methods.

3- The use of the keyword "this" should be avoided.

4- The source documentation will be created with Java doc.
